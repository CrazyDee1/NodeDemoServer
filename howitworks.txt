Node demo server overview

- Server: Plain `http.createServer` listening on port 3000; logs startup URL.
- CORS: Allows origin http://dboxmusic.local and methods GET/POST/OPTIONS; replies 204 for preflight OPTIONS.
- Static files: Requests starting with /static read the matching file from the local path (relative to the project root) and return it as text/html; missing files yield 404 text.
- /endpoint1: Returns 8 random track objects selected from a built-in `tracks` array.
- /endpoint2: Placeholder that currently responds with JSON `{ message: 'Endpoint 2 response' }`.
- Default: Any other path returns plain text "Welcome to the server".
- Data: `tracks` is a hardcoded list of classic tracks with artist/title/album/year used by /endpoint1.
